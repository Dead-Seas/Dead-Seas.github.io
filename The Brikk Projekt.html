      <h2>New Website</h2>
      <p>This is a website the base is by ChatGPT but the javascript and articles will be made by me Brikk (also I may have edited the footer this is public when it is put online free use for all who manage to see it)! As of writing there is no javascript but that is because I have not started coding it and also you will notice if you look at my eventually publicised javascript code that it will improve over time. I am still learning javascript but know basic buttons and of course the beautiful window.alerts and console.logs</p>
